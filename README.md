A simple set of functions in javascript to take an array of student names as strings, and a) generate a new array of student objects, with first and last names; b) add subject and grade as a new key-value pair to any given student.

This is my first piece of code (of more than 1 statement) outside of coding courses, and I have used it to practice some of the javascript concepts and methods I was finding more challenging to understand.

Next step: I would like to make a dynamic, single page deployment that demonstrates how a user interface might work.
