A simple set of functions to take an array of student names as strings, and a) generate a new array of student objects, with first and last names; b) add subject and grade as a new key-value pair to any given student.


This is my first piece of unprompted code (of more than 1 statement), and I used it to practice some of the javascript concepts and methods I was finding more challenging to understand.

As at 24-01-21 it is (what I understand to be) back end only. That is to say, I haven't added an interface with html and css.

Next step: I would like to make a dynamic, single page deployment that demonstrates how a user interface might work.
